    <p>My name is Shawn Pineda and I'm taking this class to complete one of the prerequisites to transfer to CSU and pursue a degree in mechanical engineering as my main goal for now. A secondary goal I'm pursuing on my own time is learning to be a web developer since that career path has applications in just as many industries as mechanical engineering.</p>
